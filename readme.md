# Adding Command Prompt and PowerShell manus in Windows' right-click menu.

99% of this repository is based upon the work of Andrew Richards [(link to his article)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/andrew_richards/enhancing-the-open-command-prompt-here-shift-right-click-context-menu-experience).

The examples from the original article had some issues.  Sure, it would work just fine, but it threw up some errors.  I fixed it by only removing the Extended Menu (Shift-Right Click) entries, and also privided the uninstall script.

If there are any issues in your testing please let me know.  I have only been using this on Windows 10, but it should work on any version down to 7 - provided PowerShell is enabled.

Here is a snapshot of what it will look like on Windows 10...
